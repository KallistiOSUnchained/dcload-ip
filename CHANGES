WHAT'S NEW IN 2.0.1

* dcload-ip now retries DHCP handshake if it doesn't get any response. This fixes
  a bug present on many networks where dcload-ip sends out a DHCP DISCOVER packet
  before the link is ready, then gets stuck in a loop waiting for a response that
  will never come. The DHCP handshake will be retried at regular increasing
  intervals up to 30 secs between retries. While retrying the handshake, a counter
  will appear showing the retries. Upon receiving a DHCP acknowledgement, the
  counter text will be cleared to then show the DHCP lease time.

WHAT'S NEW IN 2.0.0

* The number of packets dc-tool sends per burst, as well as the delay between
  packet bursts, can now be configured in Makefile.cfg. Not all networks are the
  same, so this allows customizing dc-tool per-network. [Moopthehedgehog]
* dcload packet payload sizes have been changed to 1452 bytes from 1036 bytes,
  increasing data transfer performance by over 1.4x. This will break for networks
  that use MTUs < 1500, so there's now a -l switch that will force legacy 1024-byte
  payloads. Also, legacy mode data is now limited to 11MB, while RAM is the limit
  for standard mode. [Moopthehedgehog]
* The UDP port that dcload uses can now be set by the dc-tool '-t' option; just use
  '-t <ip>:<port>' and it will override the default UDP port (53535 for v2.0.0+, it
  was 31313 for legacy 1.x versions) with the specified one. Using -t without the
  port will simply use the default port. [Moopthehedgehog]
* BBA now runs at its full 100Mbps, and the LAN adapter is maxed at 10Mbps. Due
  to the way dc-tool achieves high performance, ethernet cables that are too long
  and complicated network topologies may cause problems like dropped packets.
  [Moopthehedgehog]
* LAN Adapter is now bug fixed and fully supported. Functions just like the BBA,
  but slower. Note that it tends to hang up or error out when data is sent to it
  too quickly, necessitating a console reboot. It's just not the greatest piece
  of equipment. Hang check: A 10MB program should not take more than about 9-12
  seconds to transfer. [Moopthehedgehog]
* LAN Adapter now has a green background; the BBA still has its blue one.
  [Moopthehedgehog]
* Automatic detection and performance tuning depending on which adapter is installed.
  WARNING: This is a semi-major change, and though dc-tool-ip 2.0.0 is still
  backwards compatible with older versions of dcload-ip, it will not work
  optimally unless used with dcload-ip 2.0.0. [Moopthehedgehog]

WHAT'S NEW IN 1.1.1

* Overhauled the video subsystem, so non-VGA PAL video works now. VGA output is
  also not egregiously shifted upwards anymore like it used to be. [Moopthehedgehog]
* Fixed startup code bugs that have probably been there for decades and would
  cause random crashes when bss would go out of alignment, particularly if there
  were no bss section. The startup code would also overwrite 4 bytes beyond the
  end of the binary because it was using the wrong comparison instruction. Yay.
  [Moopthehedgehog]
* Fixed the example-src folder, as it was in pretty bad shape. [Moopthehedgehog]
* Fixed the exception handler so that it actually works now, and it dumps
  exceptions over the network (both to the dc-tool console and to a file named
  "dcload_exception_dump.bin" in whatever directory the terminal is currently
  in) in addition to printing them on-screen. [Moopthehedgehog]

WHAT'S NEW IN 1.1.0

* IPv4 DHCP support! Hurray! It's got a nifty DHCP lease countdown timer, too,
  which persists across loaded programs to keep track of time for DHCP renewal
  purposes without impacting running programs. [Moopthehedgehog]
* Performance counter monitoring support from across the network. The Dreamcast
  has two 48-bit performance counters that can be configured independently in a
  variety of ways, and this functionality allows for controlling them in much the
  same way the a Maple passthrough support from 1.0.5.
  -- One of the counters is used to keep track of time for DHCP, but it can be
  disabled by a packet if it's needed for user programs (the DHCP timer will be
  totally off if this is done, but there isn't anything we can do about that,
  sorry. That really should never be an issue, though, and bear in mind that they
  cannot be written to with an initial value to count from, so no saving/restoring
  state that way). [Moopthehedgehog]
* Added an option in Makefile.cfg to slow down dc-tool a tiny bit to help with
  CPU usage on laptops that run the network polling loop far faster in 2020 than
  laptops did in 2004. It's called "SAVE_MY_FANS" [Moopthehedgehog]
* Added support for GCC 9.2 (if using GCC 4.x from KallistiOS, make sure
  USING_KOS_GCC is uncommented in Makefile.cfg) [Moopthehedgehog]
* Presumably many tens of issues were fixed. Feels like a hundred, honestly, but
  it's probably more like 20-30. The whole Dreamcast side of the program got a
  pretty major backend overhaul. [Moopthehedgehog]

WHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.5

* Maple passthrough support.
* Some fixes.
* No one ever really documented the changes from 1.0.4 to 1.0.5.

WHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.4

* Maintenance versions of dcload moved into the CA CVS repository on
  SourceForge with the blessings of adk. Please send future bug reports and
  patches to bard@allusion.net. If there is sufficient demand, we'll setup
  a separate mailing list for it, but you can also join the KOS mailing
  list for dcload questions.
* Fix for a bug that makes the last 1024 bytes of an uploaded file sometimes
  come out as garbage [Jason Fritcher/Jim Ursetto]
* Hack to avoid some segfaults in dc-tool [adk]
* Use configured LD, not sh-elf-ld in 1st_read [adk]
* Integrated Lan Adapter support [Dan Potter]
* Broadband Adapter driver improvements [dp]
* Colorized backgrounds for status (green, red) [dp]
* Moved text display down and right a bit to avoid border-chop [dp]
* Retries weren't discarding DONEBIN packet in host tool [Walter van Niftrik]
* Multi-pass retry in host tool to avoid incorrect data [dp]
* Renamed some conflicting struct members for glibc2.3.x [WvN]

WHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.3

* actually seems to be working right, unlike 1.0.1 and 1.0.2, which were both
  buggy as hell under many (most?) conditions. If 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 locked up,
  went berzerk, or did other strange and horrible things when you used them,
  try 1.0.3.
* dc-tool should now be able to recover from dropped packets in nearly all
  cases (prior versions would just get stuck if certain packets got dropped)
* gethostinfo syscall now returns the dreamcast's ip, in addition to the ip
  and port of the dc-tool host
* dcload-ip now reports "link change..." on the status line while the rtl8139
  is negotiating. This message should be displayed momentarily when dcload-ip
  starts, when you execute dc-tool -r, or if you disconnect and reconnect the
  ethernet cable. If the message stays there, check your ethernet cable.

WHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.2

* fixed bug where rx configuration was not restored properly
  (only affected dcload syscalls - could cause dc-tool to segfault apparently,
   and who knows what else...)

WHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.1

* works with 100mbit now
* added syscall to return the ip and port of the dc-tool host
* added O_BINARY to all open()s in dc-tool to help cygwin users

WHATS NEW IN 1.0.0

* initial release of dcload-ip
